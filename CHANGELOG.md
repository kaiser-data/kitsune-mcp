## [0.10.1] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **`_make_proxy` no longer forwards `None` for omitted optional params.** When a client called a shapeshifted tool without supplying optional non-string args (integers, booleans, arrays), the proxy filled them with `None` from its `__signature__` defaults and forwarded those `None`s to the inner MCP server, which rejected them with `Input validation error: None is not of type 'integer'` (JSON Schema doesn't permit null for typed params unless explicitly declared as `["type", "null"]`). Affected most non-trivial servers — `mcp-server-fetch` (`max_length`, `start_index`, `raw`), GitHub (`per_page`, `page`), Postgres/SQLite (`limit`, `offset`), Filesystem (`head`, `tail`). The proxy now drops `None`-valued kwargs so the inner server applies its own defaults instead. Falsy-but-not-None values (`0`, `False`, `""`) are preserved. Surfaced during the v0.10.0 setup-coverage tests against `mcp-server-fetch`.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Auto-resolution of typo'd / wrong-namespace server IDs in `shapeshift()`** — `shapeshift("@modelcontextprotocol/server-time")` now silently resolves to the canonical `mcp-server-time` and proceeds, instead of returning a confusing "not found" error. Multiple plausible matches surface as a `Did you mean: a, b, c` suggestion list. Single high-confidence match auto-resolves on the first turn — agents recover without needing a retry. Closes #6 (the verified piece — see issue thread).
- **Machine-detectable failure marker** — every `shapeshift()` failure response now starts with `❌ shapeshift failed:` so callers can detect failure with one prefix check instead of parsing prose. Successful responses still start with `Shapeshifted into '...'`.
- **`_PaginatedListRegistry` base class** — `McpRegistryIO` and `GlamaRegistry` share a hookable paginated-fetch loop. New paginated registries now cost ~10 lines of overrides instead of ~30 lines of fresh page-loop code.
- **`TTLDict[K, V]` cache primitive** — keyed time-to-live cache with lazy expiry; replaces the ad-hoc `dict[tuple, (value, expires_at)]` pattern that was scattered across `MultiRegistry`.
- **`_fastmcp_compat` shim** — single point of contact for FastMCP private-API access (`_resource_manager._resources`, `_prompt_manager._prompts`). `_assert_internals(mcp)` runs at app startup so any future FastMCP refactor fails loudly at import rather than silently breaking `shiftback()`.
- **Per-registry timeout in `MultiRegistry`** — `search()` and `get_server()` wrap each registry call in `asyncio.wait_for(..., TIMEOUT_REGISTRY_TASK)` so one stalled DNS/TCP-connect can't block the others.
- **`_dotenv_revision` invariant** — documented as monotonically non-decreasing, with a guard test so future fixtures can't break pool eviction by resetting the counter.

### Changed
- **`kitsune_mcp/tools.py` (1782 lines) → `kitsune_mcp/tools/` package** with themed submodules: `discovery.py` (search/inspect/compare/status), `exec.py` (call/run/fetch/test/bench), `morph.py` (shapeshift/shiftback/craft/connect/release), `onboarding.py` (skill/key/auto/setup), `_state.py` (shared helpers + mocks-target namespace). All public imports preserved via `tools/__init__.py` re-exports — no breaking changes.
- **`ServerInfo` is now `frozen=True, slots=True`** — eliminates cache-poisoning via mutation and saves ~30% memory per instance. `dataclasses.replace(srv, ...)` continues to work.
- **`_SmitheryAuth` dataclass with `asyncio.Lock`** — replaces 4 module-level globals; concurrent `get_token()` / `get_namespace()` callers serialize on a lock with double-check, eliminating thundering-herd token refresh.
- **`_evict_stale_pool_entries()` debounced** to once per 30s on the call hot path (force=True still available for tests). Pool sweep is no longer O(N) per tool call.

### Fixed
- **Test mock-patch surface unified** — all `kitsune_mcp.tools.X` patch sites now route through `kitsune_mcp.tools._state.X`, the canonical namespace for cross-cutting state. 133 patch sites updated; future submodule refactors won't silently invalidate tests.

### Issue #6 follow-up (verification notes)
The reported "Bug 1" (`current_form` not set after shapeshift) does not reproduce against a verified-valid server ID. The agent's repro used `@modelcontextprotocol/server-time` — which doesn't exist in any registry. shapeshift correctly returned a "not found" error which the agent misread as success, then was confused when downstream `call()` had no `current_form` to use. The auto-resolution work above fixes the underlying UX failure (typo'd ID → confusing error chain) so the same pattern can't happen again. The architectural claim that ~80% of clients are blind to dynamic tool changes is partially incorrect — the standard `mcp` Python SDK honors `notifications/tools/list_changed` (which Kitsune already sends), and verification confirms tools become visible to spec-compliant clients. Specific clients that don't honor the notification are the right targets to fix once verified — defensive-only code (Solution 1 / refresh tool) deferred until verified reports exist.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- **`source=` parameter on `shapeshift()`** — `"local"` forces npx/uvx install (no Smithery key); `"smithery"` forces HTTP; `"official"` requires verified registry listing; `"auto"` (default) keeps current behavior
- **`shiftback(uninstall=True)`** — optionally uninstalls the locally installed package; uvx packages fully removed (`uv tool uninstall`), npx cache auto-expires
- **`KITSUNE_TRUST` env var** — set `"community"` to permanently bypass the community/local confirmation gate for trusted users and agents (`key("KITSUNE_TRUST", "community")`)
- **Credential status in `search()` results** — each row now shows `✅ ready` or `✗ needs API_KEY`
- **`inspect()` next-step CTA** — ends with `Next: key("VAR", "...") then shapeshift("id")` or `Next: shapeshift("id")` based on credential state
- **Lean hint after `shapeshift()`** — servers with >4 tools loaded without a filter show `💡 N tools loaded (~X tokens). For lean mounting: shapeshift("id", tools=[...])`
- **First-run onboarding in `status()`** — clean sessions show a 5-step guide with example flow
- **Registry failure reporting in `search()`** — timed-out registries shown as `⚠️ Skipped: name (timeout)` so partial results are visible

### Fixed
- **Credential check before `_do_shed()`** — missing credentials no longer drop your active form before returning the error
- **`bust_cache(server_id)` now works** — cache uses `(id, source_preference)` tuple keys; old `pop(str)` silently missed every entry
- **`source="official"` gate ordering** — official-source check fires before the trust gate, giving the right error for non-official servers
- **Pool path `current_form_local_install` leak** — pool shapeshift clears local install record so stale data can't trigger `uninstall=True` on the wrong package

### Changed
- `shapeshift()` pool-path and registry-path share a single `_commit_shapeshift()` helper — ~70 lines of duplication removed
- `_credentials_ready()` calls `_to_env_var(k)` once per key instead of three times
- `MultiRegistry._reg_names` precomputed at init instead of on every `search()` call

---

## [0.8.5] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **Circular import** between `registry.py` and `official_registry.py` — `_registry` is now
  a lazy proxy; `MultiRegistry()` is deferred until first use
- **Ruff lint** — 64 errors resolved (import ordering, unused vars, SIM105, B023, UP046);
  CI pipeline is now fully green on Python 3.12 and 3.13

### Added
- Codecov coverage reporting (badge in README, uploads on every CI run)
- Automated GitHub Releases with CHANGELOG excerpt on tag push
- Glama registry listing (`glama.json`)
- Dependabot for weekly pip + GitHub Actions updates
- SECURITY.md and PR template

---

## [0.8.2] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- npm wrapper package — `npx kitsune-mcp` delegates to `uvx kitsune-mcp` (Python)
- Official MCP registry listing (`server.json` for `mcp-publisher`)
- `mcp-name` ownership tag in README for registry verification

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **Smithery transport rewritten** — replaced dead `server.smithery.ai/{name}/mcp?config=b64` URL
  with the new Smithery Connect API: namespace → service token → connection upsert →
  `api.smithery.ai/connect/{ns}/{id}/mcp`. Fixes 400 "Server configuration is incomplete"
  and "Invalid token" errors from `run.tools`.
- **Registry** now reads `deploymentUrl` from Smithery API response instead of reconstructing stale URLs
- **`_resolve_config`** always writes all credential keys (`None` → JSON `null`) so Smithery's
  schema validator sees all expected keys even when optional vars are unset

### Changed
- `morph.py` → `shapeshift.py` (rename complete; `morph.py` deleted)
- Session keys: `morphed_tools/resources/prompts` → `shapeshift_tools/resources/prompts`
- `.chameleon` directory references → `.kitsune` in `credentials.py`, `session.py`, `transport.py`
- Docker label: `chameleon-mcp=1` → `kitsune-mcp=1`

---

## [0.6.2] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- `receive()` cold-start: prefer registry results with cached tool schemas over those without (fixes Exa cold-start failure)
- Live `tools/list` HTTP fetch fallback when registry cache is cold
- Smithery URL format: `/mcp` suffix + `api_key` query param (was using wrong format)
- Doubled Smithery URL when `srv.url` was already a full URL
- Pool staleness: auto-evict subprocesses when `.env` changes mid-session

---

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- Frictionless credentials: `.env` auto-reload without restart (tracks mtime changes)
- `call()` is mount-aware: `server_id` optional after `receive()`
- `call()` added to lean profile (7 tools total)
- WebSocket transport support (`ws://`, `wss://`)

### Added
- `receive()` proxies resources + prompts in addition to tools
- Install command validation (shell injection and path traversal blocked)
- Trust tier warnings in `receive()` output
- Credential warnings at mount-time (not just at `call()`-time)

---

## [0.5.9] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- Refactored into `kitsune_mcp/` package structure
- `OfficialMCPRegistry` — seeds from `modelcontextprotocol/servers` GitHub repo
- `inspect()` stores measured `token_cost` from actual tool schemas
- `status()` sums measured costs for inspected-but-not-mounted servers
- Per-server trust tier tracking

### Fixed
- Registry fan-out priority: official > mcpregistry > glama > github > smithery > npm
- PyPI registry is opt-in only (not in default fan-out — too slow)
